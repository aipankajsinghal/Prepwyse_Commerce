## Features NOT in Phase Plan (Future Considerations)

The following features are described in IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md but are NOT included in any phase of PENDING_ITEMS.md:

### Low Priority / Future Features

1. **Live Classes & Webinars** (Section 9)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Complex implementation, requires live infrastructure
   - Future: May consider after platform stability

2. **Essay Grading** (Section 29)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Very high effort, requires advanced NLP
   - Future: Long-term AI enhancement

3. **Voice-Based Quiz** (Section 30)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Nice to have, but not critical
   - Future: Accessibility feature consideration

4. **Formula & Concept Bank** (Section 34)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Can be part of Study Notes
   - Future: May integrate into Phase D Study Notes

5. **Third-Party Integrations** (Section 35)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Requires partnerships and complexity
   - Future: Based on user demand

6. **Public API** (Section 36)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Not needed for initial launch
   - Future: For ecosystem expansion

7. **Social Features** (Section 21)
   - Status: Not planned
   - Reason: Low priority, requires moderation
   - Future: May add after discussion forums

### Technical Debt Items (Ongoing)

These are continuous improvement items, not specific features:

1. **Performance Optimization** (Section 10)
   - Status: Ongoing
   - Priority: High
   - Part of: All development phases

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (Section 12)
   - Status: Partial
   - Priority: High
   - Recommendation: Add formal test suite

3. **Enhanced Security** (Section 16)
   - Status: Implemented (basics)
   - Priority: High
   - Ongoing: Security audits and updates

4. **Accessibility Improvements** (Section 22)
   - Status: Partial
   - Priority: Medium
   - Target: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

---

## Discrepancies Found and Resolved

### 1. Practice Papers Duplicate Entry
**Issue:** PENDING_ITEMS.md has Practice Papers listed twice:
- As ID 19 in Phase D Pre-Launch
- As ID 31 in detailed section

**Resolution:** Both refer to the same feature. ID 19 is the correct reference. Section 31 in IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md provides implementation details.

**Action:** No change needed - both documents are consistent.

---

### 2. ID Number Sequencing
**Observation:** IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md uses IDs 1-23 in the summary table, but detailed sections use different numbering (27-39).

**Clarification:** 
- IDs 1-23: Feature IDs in summary table
- Sections 27-39: Document section numbers in detailed descriptions
- No conflict - different numbering systems

**Action:** No change needed - this is intentional organization.

---

### 3. Phase Assignments Consistent
**Verification:** All phase assignments match between documents:
- IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md Phase column
- PENDING_ITEMS.md Phase sections

**Result:** ✅ 100% consistent

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Consider Adding to Phase Plan

The following features from IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md are well-defined but not in the phase plan. Consider if they should be added:

**High Value, Low Effort:**
- **Formula & Concept Bank** - Could be integrated into Study Notes (Phase D)
- **Accessibility Improvements** - Should be continuous across all phases

**Future Consideration:**
- **Live Classes & Webinars** - Post-launch feature (after platform stability)
- **Public API** - Long-term ecosystem feature
- **Essay Grading** - Advanced AI feature for later

### 2. Documentation Synchronization

✅ Both documents are well synchronized  
✅ Status updates are consistent  
✅ No action required currently

**Recommendation:** Continue updating both documents together when features move from "Not Started" to "In Progress" to "Completed"

### 3. Priority Alignment

✅ Pre-launch priorities match between documents  
✅ Post-launch deferrals are consistent  

**Validation:** The 3 critical pre-launch features are correctly identified:
1. Practice Papers (ID 19)
2. Study Notes (ID 21)  
3. Advanced Search (ID 22)
